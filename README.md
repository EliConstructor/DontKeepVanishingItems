Minecraft mod that lets items with curse of vanishing disappear on death even when the keep inventory gamerule is enabled.

Normally items with curse of vanishing don't disappear when the player dies with keep inventory enabled, essentially making the curse pointless on a world or server with keep inventory. This mod is simply one mixin that makes the items disappear even if keep inventory is enabled, making the curse actually a curse.

I am by no means an expert or even knowledgable about how mixins work, but in my own testing the mod seems to work fine, but no promises. :P
